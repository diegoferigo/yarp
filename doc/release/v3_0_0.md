=====================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+v3.0.0%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

* All YARP libraries can now be modified and distributed under the terms of the
  BSD-3-Clause license. See the accompanying LICENSE file for details.
* Visual Studio 2013 is no longer supported.

### Libraries

#### `YARP_conf`

* The `YARP_WRAP_STL_STRING` and `YARP_WRAP_STL_STRING_INLINE` are now
  always undefined, and they are now considered deprecated.

#### `YARP_OS`

* The `shmem` carrier is no longer builtin inside `YARP_OS` and it is now a
  plugin.
* The `Run` class was moved to the new library `YARP_run`
* `yarp::os::setprogname()` is now deprecated.
* `yarp::os::getprogname()` is now deprecated.
* `yarp::os::SystemInfo::getProcessInfo()` now returns info for current process
  when called without arguments.
* The methods `yarp::os::Mutex::tryLock()` and
  `yarp::os::RecursiveMutex::tryLock()` were deprecated in favour of
  `try_lock()`.
* `ConstString` is now deprecated in favour of `std::string`.

#### `YARP_sig`

* The file `yarp/sig/IplImage.h` is deprecated, use opencv headers instead.
* Added the `yarp::sig::PointCloud` class. See the documentation for details.

#### `YARP_dev`

* The `serial` device is no longer a plugin, but it is automatically built with
  `YARP_dev`.
* The following devices are no longer built with `YARP_dev` and are now plugins:
  * `ServerSoundGrabber`
  * `BatteryClient`
  * `BatteryWrapper`
  * `FrameTransformClient`
  * `FrameTransformServer`
  * `Localization2DClient`
  * `Map2DClient`
  * `Map2DServer`
  * `Navigation2DClient`
  * `Rangefinder2DClient`
  * `Rangefinder2DWrapper`
* The following headers were removed:
  * `/yarp/dev/DeviceGroup.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/DevicePipe.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/IKinectDeviceDriver.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/IOpenNI2DeviceDriver.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/RemoteFrameGrabber.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/ServerFrameGrabber.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/ServerSerial.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/ServerSoundGrabber.h`
  * `/yarp/dev/TestMotor.h`
* A class of interfaces to wrap multiple analog sensors is now available in:
  * `/yarp/dev/MultipleAnalogSensorsInterfaces.h`
* The devices `multipleanalogsensorsserver`, `multipleanalogsensorsclient` and
  `multipleanalogsensorsremapper` are available for exposing and accessing the
  multiple analog sensors over a network, and for combining multiple devices in
  a single device (*remapper*).
* Major changes to IPidControlImpl.cpp to allow conversion of PID gains from
  metric to machine units.
* Major changes to `TorqueControlImpl` to allow conversion of `bemf`, `ktau`
  parameters from metric to machine units.
* Major changes to `ControlBoardHelper` classes, implementation is now contained
  in a separate `.cpp` file. Removed inline functions.
* Added file `PidEnums.h`
* Added missing method `setNominalCurrentRaw()` to `IAmplifierControl`
  interface.
* Removed all control board interfaces methods e.g. `setTorquePid()`,
  `setPositionMode()` etc, marked as deprecated since 2.3.70
* In ControlBoardWrapper functions for all joints invoke the equivalent function for all joints of motion control device. In the   previous versions, that funcions call the equivalent function single-joint in a for-cicle, so the function for all joints in motion control devices have never been called. So please, check the implementation of function for all joints in your motion control device because now they will be invoked for the fisrt time.

#### `YARP_sig`

* The file `yarp/sig/IplImage.h` is deprecated, use opencv headers instead.

#### `YARP_manager`

* The following headers were removed:
  * `/yarp/manager/ymm-dir.h`

#### `libyarpcxx`

* The `libyarpcxx` was removed.

#### `YARP_math`

* added new utility methods to Quaternion class.
* method toRotationMatrix() has been renamed to toRotationMatrix4x4() to avoid
  confusion with method toRotationMatrix3x3().

New Features
------------

#### `YARP OS`

* New `ThreadStats` and `MultipleThreadStats` classes for calculating statistic informations
  on periodic functions.

### Libraries

* New auto-generated interface libraries for ros messages:
  * YARP_rosmsg_std_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_actionlib_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_diagnostic_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_geometry_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_nav_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_sensor_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_shape_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_stereo_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_trajectory_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_visualization_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg_tf
  * YARP_rosmsg_tf2_msgs
  * YARP_rosmsg (includes all the other rosmsg libraries)

#### YARP_OS

* yarp::os::Mutex and yarp::os::RecursiveMutex now implement the
  [C++11 Mutex concept](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/Mutex).
* Added a Timer class to execute a static or member function in a separate
  thread after a period x, every y milliseconds, for z times or w seconds.

#### YARP_sig

* `yarp::sig::file::[read|write](ImageOf<PixelFloat>&)` services
  refactored to store data in binary formats.

### Carriers

* `mjpeg` carrier is now compatible also with mono images.


### Tools

#### `yarpidl_thrift`

* Ported to thrift 0.11.0.

#### `yarpidl_rosmsg`

* Fixed verbose output.
* Added new --no-cache argument.
* Added new --no-index argument.
* Fixed generation when message files are in the msg folder.
* Added new --no-recurse argument. This option can be enabled when using
  `yarp_idl_to_dir` and `yarp_add_idl`, using the `NO_RECURSE` argument.
* Classes are now in the `yarp::rosmsg` namespace.
* Files are now in the `yarp/rosmsg` subfolder.
* `_indexALL.txt` files are generated only for the requested types.
* Old style files are still generated if `yarpidl_rosmsg` is not built with
  `YARP_NO_DEPRECATED` enabled, but they are considered deprecated.
* Only required included files are now included.
* Updated YarpIDL to support the new file names in `yarp_add_idl`.


### Devices

#### `ControlBoardWrapper`

* Added error code in attaching subdevices.
* Added realsense2 device.


### bindings

#### IMotorEncoders interface bindings

* `IMotorEncoders` interface methods can be used to directly monitor the motor shaft position and speed or even to control the motor positions individually when estimating coupled motors friction parameters.
* Added bindings for the interface IMotorEncoders. The change extends the `yarp::dev::PolyDriver` and the `yarp::dev::IMotorEncoders` classes.


Bug Fixes
---------

### Libraries

#### `YARP_OS`

* Fixed race condition in yarp::os::Nodes.

#### `GUIs`

* Made `yarpdataplayer` able to deal with `ImageOf<PixelFloat>` also with
  OpenCV.
